I have provided the link for dataset below which I have used in Car price prediction project
Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset

Outcome : 
          The goal is to select the model with the best accuracy (R-squared value) and
          lowest error (Mean Squared Error).Based on this, you can use the model to 
          predict future car prices.
